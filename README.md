# Rust-Web-server-

In this respository there is two types of server that is built only with rust, and also be able work and function when testing or already built websites. 
These servers can hold many different types of file but for the use of functionality, the use of HTML is only used.

Below, what the difference is between each of the servers and how they can benefit when building your application:

Single threaded Server:

This server can be used for when you want to build a website using a server to see how it will function when online, can be used to port forward to show to the internet
to show its functionality. This server is useful for development of onlne services but can become slow if multiple users are entering into the server domain.

Multi-Threaded Server:

This server acts the same as the single threaded server, but multiple user are online on your website, you can be able to do multiple functions at once to reduce slow requests to
your site when people are using it. Also, to free up processes when people are looking at your site, the server will remove all processes from the selected device in your site and 
be able to use the website offline until someone uses a link to go to another part of the website. This means that server will not be processing anything whilst a device is on a s
selected page.
